            My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the
            northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not
            married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores,
            and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest.

            I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and
            make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a
            glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches
            before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until
            morning.

            Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the
            morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm
            trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet
            life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like
            winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That
            is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me
            happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

            The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test
            that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter
            pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The
            running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you
            hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time
            you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and
            run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap
            before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word
            start. On your mark, get ready, start.

              To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and
              Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of
              theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical
              viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is
              deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy
              draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

              The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual
              capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize
              that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE.
              As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE
              idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the
              humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"
              which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic
              Fathers and Sons.
